# ETL Application for Exchange Rates

This ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) application fetches exchange rate data from Open Exchange Rates API, transforms the dataset to convert rates from USD to EUR, and loads it into a PostgreSQL database. It also includes functionality to create materialized views and daily views of the exchange rates.
